# Comparison:
To compare Manifest to Vue.js, React.js, and Angular.js, let's use each to code a working replica of the IOS Messenger UI with a websocket setup of your choice, ignoring back-end code.

At the end we'll compare character count as well as coupling patterns present in each code set. Our goal is components of the app loosely coupled to eachother but a strong coupling between the model and view, with as little work as possible while maintaining intuitive, self-documenting code.
